## Disclaimer

Let‚Äôs get this out of the way: Most everything written here could be vastly improved upon.

- There is a lot of `lodash` (which I use because I have not commited every thing about `arrays|hashes|objects` to my memory, heh)
- There is a lot `any` w/ TS (you will see a lot of `@todo(types)`, they will come with time [or not])
- I think there is a MIT on this, but truly do whatever you want I will get that altered. Right now looking at `UNLICENSE`
