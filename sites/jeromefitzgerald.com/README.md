## Disclaimer

Let’s get this out of the way: Most everything written here could be vastly improved upon.

- I use `lodash` because I do not care to remember all the nuances of everything between `arrays|hashes|objects|etc.` at all times of my life.
- I also tend to use `any` a lot with TypeScript. You will see a lot of `@todo(types)`, they will come with time (or not).
